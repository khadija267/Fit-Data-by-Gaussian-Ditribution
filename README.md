# Fit-Data-by-Gaussian-Ditribution
Fit data of height using a non-linear Regression Model of the Gaussian Distribution.
We used ...
## steepest descent algorithm:
We evaluated the jacobiab vector (1X2) , each element represent the chi-squared term. chi-squared = (y-yhat)^2 => yhat is y of the Gaussian Function.
To be obtained the partial derivatives once with respect to mu and once with respect to sigma.
